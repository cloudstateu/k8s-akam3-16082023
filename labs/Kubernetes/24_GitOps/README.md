# GitOps Workshop: Learning ArgoCD with Kubernetes

Welcome to this ArgoCD with Kubernetes workshop! Here, we'll be working with ArgoCD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. This workshop is based on the fork from **[cloudstateu/gitops-lab](https://github.com/cloudstateu/gitops-lab)**.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start the workshop, please ensure you have the following:

- A running Kubernetes cluster (Local clusters like minikube or Docker Desktop work too)
- kubectl installed and configured to interact with your cluster
- A GitHub account
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes and GitOps principles

## **Installation**

### **Install ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster**

We'll start by installing ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following commands:

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

### **Access the ArgoCD User Interface**

ArgoCD provides a user interface where you can visualize and control your deployments. You can access it by running these commands:

```
kubectl get svc -n argocd
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:443 -n argocd
```

### **Login to ArgoCD**

By default, ArgoCD creates an **`admin`** user. You can retrieve the auto-generated password using this command:

```
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode && echo
```

Login using the **`admin`** user and the token outputted by the above command.

Once you're logged in, it's a good practice to change and delete the initial password. Refer to ArgoCD's documentation for the procedure.

### **Update `application.yaml` with Forked Repository URL**

Before deploying an application to Kubernetes, we need to make sure that the ArgoCD application's configuration points to the correct Git repository. The repository should be the one where your application's Kubernetes manifests are stored.

For this task, you'll update the **`application.yaml`** file with the URL of your forked repository.

1. Open the **`application.yaml`** file in a text editor of your choice.
2. Locate the **`source`** section:
    
    ```
    yamlCopy code
    source:
        repoURL: <place-url-to-forked-repo>
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: dev
    
    ```
    
3. Replace **`<place-url-to-forked-repo>`** with the URL of your forked repository:
    
    ```
    yamlCopy code
    source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: dev
    
    ```
    
4. Save and close the **`application.yaml`** file.

### **Deploy an Application to Kubernetes cluster**

You can use ArgoCD to manage applications on your cluster. Here's an example of how to do this using an **`application.yaml`** file:

```
kubectl apply -f application.yaml
```

This command will create an ArgoCD application based on the specifications defined in your **`application.yaml`** file.

### **Exercise 1: Changing Replica Count in Kubernetes Deployment**

In this exercise, you will change the number of replicas for your deployment directly from the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Check your current deployment's replica count:
    
    ```
    kubectl get deployment myapp -n myapp
    ```
    
2. Update the replica count:
    
    ```
    
    kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=8 -n myapp
    ```
    
3. Verify the change in ArgoCD UI.

### **Exercise 2: Changing Replica Count in Git**

In this exercise, you will change the number of replicas for your deployment directly from Git.

1. Open your **`deployment.yaml`** file in your Git repository.
2. Locate the **`replicas`** field and change its value to the desired replica count.
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Wait for ArgoCD to sync the changes. Verify the change in the ArgoCD UI.


### **Exercise 3: Understanding automated**

The **`spec.syncPolicy.automated`** attribute, when exists, allows ArgoCD to automatically apply changes from the Git repository to the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Comment **`spec.syncPolicy.automated`** in your **`application.yaml`** manifest file in ArgoCD.
2. Apply changed file or ready file
    ```
    kubectl apply -f application_manual.yaml
    ```
3. Refresh, ArgoCD doesn't synchronize the changes automatically. You must manually sync from the ArgoCD UI.
4. Try to sync manually, click options on deploy named: myapp, then Sync.
5. From menu, set: SYNCHRONIZE RESOURCES: all
6. Tick: PRUNE
7. On Top click: Synchronize
8. Uncomment **`spec.syncPolicy.automated`** in your **`application.yaml`** manifest file in ArgoCD.
9. Apply:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f application.yaml
    ```
10. Again, make a change in your Git repository.
11. Refresh, Observe that ArgoCD automatically synchronizes the changes.


### **Exercise 4: Delete all**

    kubectl delete -f application.yaml
    kubectl delete namespace argocd
